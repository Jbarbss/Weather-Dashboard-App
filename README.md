## 1. Description

I created an application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
When the application is opened the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
you can scroll down and are presented with time blocks for standard business hours and each time
block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When you click on a time block, you can enter text about the certain event for that hour.
If you click save the button, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
Also if you refresh the page the saved events persist.
